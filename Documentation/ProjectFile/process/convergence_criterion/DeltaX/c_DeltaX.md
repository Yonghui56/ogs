Sets up a convergence criterion that checks only the norm of the solution update
from one iteration to another.

A relative and/or absolute tolerance value can be specified, which is applied to
the norm of the whole solution vector, i.e., the entirety of all process
variables.

At least one of the relative or absolute tolerance has to be met in order to
satisfy this convergence criterion.
