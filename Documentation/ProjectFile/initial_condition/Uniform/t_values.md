A space separated list of floating point values, one for each component.
The length of the list must match the number of the variable's components.

The given floating point values will be set as initial condition for the
respective components on the entire domain.

For single component variables one can _optionally_ use the \ref
ogs_file_param__initial_condition__Uniform__value "value tag".
